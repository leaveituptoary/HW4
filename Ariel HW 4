brfss_ACE <- subset(brfss22, select_ACE)
For the task, we will check how the different options for treating yes, no, don’t know and refused. Meaning we will conduct the analysis for each of the 3 options.

Maybe the first blank is “yes” but next three are “no”; or first blank is “yes” then “no” then 2 more “yes”; or yes/no/NULL/NULL. Try each and look how the hypothesis test varies.

Option 1: First blank is “yes” and next three are “no”
The first option is to treat yes as yes, and the other options as no.

To do that, we will be factor re-coding our data frame, and to make sure we didn’t re-code the original data frame, the best way is to copy 3 different data frames and edit each for one option only.

# copying 3 dataframes
brfss_ACE_1 <- brfss_ACE # dataframe 1
brfss_ACE_2 <- brfss_ACE # dataframe 2
brfss_ACE_3 <- brfss_ACE # dataframe 3

brfss_ACE_1$ACEDRINK_recode <- fct_recode(
  brfss_ACE_1$ACEDRINK, 
  "Yes" = "Yes, Adverse Childhood Exper, lived with someone who was a problem drinker or alcoholic",
  "No" = "No",
  "No" = "dont know not sure",
  "No" = "refused")
What fraction of the sample lived with a problem drinker?
I will handle this part in 3 different ways, counts, proportion and Fraction

Statistical Test
Form a hypothesis test: is there a difference between the fraction of people who lived with a problem drinker, and the same fraction, conditional on also living with someone with drug problem?

Null Hypothesis:

There is no significant difference between the proportions of the two groups being compared. Meaning, the proportion of people who lived with a problem drinker is the same as the proportion of people who lived with a problem drinker and someone with a drug problem.

Alternative Hypothesis:

The alternative hypothesis suggests that there is a significant difference between the proportions of the two groups. In this case, it means the proportion of people who lived with a problem drinker is different from the proportion of people who lived with both a problem drinker and someone with a drug problem.

# Calculate the sample sizes
n_yes <- sum(brfss_ACE_1$ACEDRINK_recode == "Yes")
n_both_yes <- sum(brfss_ACE_1$ACEDRINK_recode == "Yes" & brfss_ACE_1$ACEDRUGS_recode == "Yes")

# proportion test
prop.test(c(n_yes,n_both_yes), c(total,total), cor=F)
## 
##  2-sample test for equality of proportions without continuity correction
## 
## data:  c(n_yes, n_both_yes) out of c(total, total)
## X-squared = 5564.9, df = 1, p-value < 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: two.sided
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  0.1687681 0.1776006
## sample estimates:
##     prop 1     prop 2 
## 0.23913950 0.06595514
The p-values is less than 0.05, suggesting that the proportion of people who lived with a problem drinker is significantly different from the proportion of people who lived with both a problem drinker and someone with a drug problem.

Option 2: first blank is “yes” then “no” then 2 more “yes”

Option 3: yes/no/NULL/NULL
Re-coding

When re-coding this, I did not want the nulls to be a level, so I first re-coded to only include the Yes or No category, then I removed the ‘don’t know’ and ‘refused’ categories. But even after removing them, remember that they are already included in the levels. So I proceeded to omit them from the levels, so that I could remaining with just 2 levels, yes or No.

# Recode levels using fct_recode() and keep NA values as NA data type
brfss_ACE_3$ACEDRINK_recode <- fct_recode(
  brfss_ACE_3$ACEDRINK, 
  "Yes" = "Yes, Adverse Childhood Exper, lived with someone who was a problem drinker or alcoholic",
  "No" = "No")

# Remove rows where ACEDRINK is "dont know not sure" or "refused"
brfss_ACE_3 <- brfss_ACE_3[!(brfss_ACE_3$ACEDRINK %in% c("dont know not sure", "refused")), ]
